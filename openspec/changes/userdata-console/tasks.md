## 0. Before you write any code

Read `design.md` in full, especially D-C1 (the backfill is a correction of
the pre-fix scheme, not a general migration pattern) and D-C3 (the content
column always shows `N`, confirmed against `03-data-model.md`'s type table —
don't special-case by occurrence side). Read `progress-sync-shim`'s shipped
`hub/migrations/013_userdata.sql`, `hub/src/userdata.js`, and
`patches/js/progress-sync-restore-companion.js` before touching any of
them — this change extends shipped code, it doesn't re-derive it.

## 1. `device_state` per-device key

- [ ] 1.1 Migration: `device_state.uid TEXT`, backfilled from the existing
      `device_id` column (every pre-existing row's `device_id` was actually
      a uid — `uid = device_id` is the correct one-time correction, not a
      general pattern), then `NOT NULL`; index on `uid`.
- [ ] 1.2 `hub/src/userdata.js`: the device-status write path accepts
      `{ deviceId, activeBuildId, pendingBuildId, audioCached, audioTotal,
      lastFetchError }` from the request body and upserts `device_state`
      keyed by `deviceId`, storing the path's uid into `device_state.uid`
      alongside it.
- [ ] 1.3 `hub/src/server.js`: `PATCH /mjolnir/userdata/:uid` reads
      `deviceId` from the body (required for the device-status half of the
      payload; absent `deviceId` simply skips the `device_state` write,
      same as today's behavior if no device-status fields are present at
      all).
- [ ] 1.4 Tests: two `PATCH`s with the same uid but different `deviceId`s
      produce two separate `device_state` rows; a device that stops sending
      requests keeps its last-written row unchanged when a different
      device's later sync arrives; the backfill populates `uid` correctly
      for a pre-existing row.

## 2. Restore companion mints a device id

- [ ] 2.1 `patches/js/progress-sync-restore-companion.js`: on first-ever
      launch (no local device-id marker), generate a random id and persist
      it permanently (independent of, never derived from, the signed-in
      uid). Every subsequent piggybacked `PATCH` includes it as `deviceId`.
- [ ] 2.2 Tests: the device id is generated exactly once and stays stable
      across subsequent launches, including a sign-out/sign-in on the same
      device.

## 3. The console page

Build exactly to the mockup —
**https://claude.ai/code/artifact/12b08e2e-0eba-4990-8125-584a71c7046a** —
read `design.md` in full first; the mockup is the source of truth for
layout, not a sketch to improve on.

- [ ] 3.1 `hub/src/userdata.js` (or a sibling module): `listAccounts()`
      (every distinct `userdata` uid), `listDevicesForAccount(uid)` (every
      `device_state` row with that `uid`, including ones no longer actively
      syncing, per D-C1's Open Question — include devices with no
      `userdata` activity too), `perCardProgress(uid)` (join
      `userdata.doc.totalCards` against `card_content` by card id — same
      join shape as `hub/src/cards.js`'s `cardsList`, reused, not
      reinvented — selecting `card_content.n` only, never `.e`, per D-C3),
      `historyDeltas(uid, {limit})` (each `userdata_history` row summarized
      against its predecessor: session-count delta, `totalCards.length`
      delta — not a full document diff).
- [ ] 3.2 `hub/src/server.js`: `GET /mjolnir/device` (route name TBD),
      rendering: identity bar (two independent selects), stat row (last
      synced, active build, audio cached with a completeness-colored pill,
      last fetch error pill), progress snapshot panel (plain label/value
      pairs + raw-JSON toggle), per-card progress table (Card id + Content
      column showing only `N`, stripped of HTML + Side chip + Deck + Stage
      + Status pill + Type + Last reviewed — labeled "Side," never
      "language"), sync history timeline (delta summaries, raw doc per row
      behind a toggle).
- [ ] 3.3 Add "Device" to `hub/src/layout.js`'s `NAV` groups, linking to
      the new page.
- [ ] 3.4 Tests: the Content column renders a card's `N` text for both its
      `N`-side and `E`-side rows identically; the identity bar's device
      selector includes a device with no recent activity (a "retired"
      device), and selecting it swaps only the device/OTA panels, leaving
      the progress panels on the selected account unchanged.

## 4. Sign-off

- [ ] 4.1 Re-run `progress-sync-shim`'s existing `hub/test/userdata.test.js`
      and `test/unit/progressSyncRestoreCompanion.test.js` suites in full —
      this change touches code both already exercise.
- [ ] 4.2 If anything here contradicts or refines `design.md` during
      implementation, record it as an ADR amendment in
      `tun/docs/07-decisions.md`, per this project's established practice.
- [ ] 4.3 **(Operator, outside this change)** Apply the updated
      `patches/js/progress-sync-restore-companion.js`, assemble/install,
      and confirm on-device: the device id persists across app restarts;
      `hub`'s new page shows this device under the right account with
      live OTA/audio state.

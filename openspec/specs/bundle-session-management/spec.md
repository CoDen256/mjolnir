## Purpose

Provide a single persistent bundle-workbench app server that a user can point at any number of bundle files by path, managing each as an independent, in-memory session, with an Explorer view over the existing read-only module surface for each open session.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Single persistent app server
The system SHALL provide a command that starts one HTTP server bound to
`127.0.0.1` without requiring a bundle path argument, serving a general
bundle-workbench UI, SHALL make that same UI reachable embedded within hub's
own operator console with no local invocation required (per
`builder-logic-bundle-store`'s embedding), and SHALL resolve its stored-
patches directory to a fixed, deployment-context-independent location rather
than the running process's current working directory.

#### Scenario: Starting the app without a bundle
- **WHEN** a user runs the UI command with no bundle argument
- **THEN** the system starts a local server bound to `127.0.0.1` and serves
  the app shell, with no bundle session open yet

#### Scenario: Patches resolve to the same directory regardless of deployment context
- **WHEN** a patch is saved via a locally-run CLI session and the same
  workbench is later reached embedded inside a deployed hub instance
- **THEN** both see the same patch — the stored-patches directory does not
  depend on either process's own working directory at the time it runs

### Requirement: Opening a bundle session by path
The system SHALL let a user open a bundle session by typing or pasting a
local filesystem path to a bundle file, and SHALL make that bundle's module
index available once opened.

#### Scenario: Opening a valid bundle path
- **WHEN** a user submits a path to an existing, parseable bundle file
- **THEN** the system opens a session for that bundle (building its module
  index if not already cached) and the Explorer view becomes available for it

#### Scenario: Opening an invalid or missing path
- **WHEN** a user submits a path that does not exist or does not parse as a
  bundle
- **THEN** the system reports a clear error and does not create a session

### Requirement: Multiple concurrent bundle sessions
The system SHALL support more than one bundle session open at the same time
within a single running server.

#### Scenario: Opening a second bundle while one is already open
- **WHEN** a user opens a second bundle path while a first bundle's session
  is already open
- **THEN** both sessions remain open and independently accessible

### Requirement: Sessions are not persisted across server restarts
The system SHALL NOT persist open bundle sessions to disk; sessions exist
only for the lifetime of the running server process.

#### Scenario: Restarting the server
- **WHEN** the server process is restarted
- **THEN** no bundle sessions are open until re-opened by path through the UI

### Requirement: Explorer view over the existing read-only module surface
The system SHALL provide an Explorer view for an open bundle session showing
a sortable, filterable list of modules (by size, classification, verbose
name) with full-text search, a per-module source view with a toggle for
deobfuscated output, and that module's dependencies/dependents.

#### Scenario: Browsing modules
- **WHEN** a user views the Explorer for an open bundle session
- **THEN** the system lists its modules with size and classification, and
  lets the user sort or filter that list

#### Scenario: Searching module source
- **WHEN** a user enters a search term in the Explorer
- **THEN** the system shows matching modules and the matching excerpt,
  equivalent to the existing `grep` command's output

#### Scenario: Viewing a module's dependencies
- **WHEN** a user opens a specific module in the Explorer
- **THEN** the system shows that module's source (raw or deobfuscated, per
  the toggle) and its direct dependencies and dependents

### Requirement: Opening a bundle session from an uploaded file
The system SHALL let a user open a bundle session by dropping a file onto the
app (or choosing one via a file picker), without requiring that file to
already exist at a known path on the server's own filesystem.

#### Scenario: Dropping a bundle file
- **WHEN** a user drags a bundle file onto the app and drops it
- **THEN** the system stages the uploaded bytes and opens a session for them,
  identical in every other respect to a session opened by path

#### Scenario: Choosing a file via a file picker
- **WHEN** a user selects a bundle file through a file-picker control instead
  of dragging one
- **THEN** the system opens a session for it the same way a drop does

### Requirement: A catalogue of previously published artifacts is browsable and one-click openable
The system SHALL provide a view listing every previously-published OTA
bundle and every submitted logic bundle, each openable as a session in one
click, without the user needing to know or type its on-disk path.

#### Scenario: Opening a past OTA build from the catalogue
- **WHEN** a user selects a previously-published build from the catalogue
- **THEN** the system opens a session for that exact build's file

#### Scenario: Opening a logic bundle from the catalogue
- **WHEN** a user selects a logic bundle (active or not) from the catalogue
- **THEN** the system opens a session for that exact logic bundle's file

### Requirement: An uploaded session is identified by a readable name, not its internal storage path
The system SHALL display an uploaded bundle's own original filename as its
session label, rather than the internal, randomized temporary path the
upload happened to be staged under.

#### Scenario: Uploading a file with a normal filename
- **WHEN** a user uploads a file named, for example, "my bundle.bundle"
- **THEN** the session is labeled using that name, not the server's internal
  temporary storage path for it

### Requirement: The operator receives visible feedback while a bundle is being opened
The system SHALL show an explicit, visible status indication while a
dropped or selected bundle is being parsed, for as long as that parsing
takes, rather than appearing unresponsive with no feedback.

#### Scenario: Opening a large bundle that takes several seconds to parse
- **WHEN** a user drops or selects a bundle whose parsing takes several
  seconds
- **THEN** the system shows a visible "working" indication for the duration,
  rather than no feedback until it suddenly completes

### Requirement: The resolved stored-patches directory is visibly diagnosable
The system SHALL display the exact, resolved absolute directory it is
reading stored patches from, next to the patches list, so an unexpectedly
empty list can be diagnosed without inspecting server configuration
directly.

#### Scenario: The patches list is empty
- **WHEN** the stored-patches directory contains no patches (including when
  this is due to a misconfigured directory override)
- **THEN** the operator can see, directly in the UI, which absolute
  directory the system is reading from

### Requirement: Repeated "open" actions reuse one workbench window
The system SHALL reuse a single, already-open workbench browser window for
subsequent "open this bundle in the workbench" actions, rather than opening
an additional new window or tab each time, so the most recently requested
bundle is always the one visibly selected.

#### Scenario: Opening a second bundle while a workbench window is already open
- **WHEN** a user triggers "open in workbench" for a different bundle while a
  workbench window from an earlier such action is still open
- **THEN** that same window navigates to and selects the newly requested
  bundle, rather than a separate new window opening

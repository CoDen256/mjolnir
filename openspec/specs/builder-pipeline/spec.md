# builder-pipeline

## Purpose

Defines the publish pipeline that pulls ready notes from stabbur, determines
eligibility and deck assignment, mints and regenerates card content, and
drives both scheduled and on-demand publishing, including the dry-run
forecast view.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Only audio-bearing ready notes are eligible
The system SHALL exclude any note lacking an `audio_blob` from eligibility,
regardless of its `type`, with no exception for any note type.

#### Scenario: A ready note with no audio
- **WHEN** builder pulls notes from stabbur and a returned note has
  `status=ready` but no `audio_blob`
- **THEN** that note is excluded from the current run and reconsidered on the
  next run

### Requirement: Deck assignment by type, then by PoS, with a catch-all
The system SHALL assign each eligible `type=word` note to a deck based on its
`pos` using the fixed substantiv/adjektiv/verb/adverb/preposisjon/
konjunksjon-subjunksjon mapping, SHALL assign every other type to its fixed
deck, and SHALL assign any note whose `pos` does not match the word-deck
mapping to the `expression` deck (C26), regardless of its `type`.

#### Scenario: A word note with an unmapped PoS
- **WHEN** an eligible `type=word` note's `pos` is not substantiv, adjektiv,
  verb, adverb, preposisjon, or konjunksjon/subjunksjon
- **THEN** it is assigned to the expression deck (C26) rather than left
  unassigned

### Requirement: Every deck with at least one newly-eligible note mints and publishes that run
The system SHALL NOT withhold minting or publishing a newly-eligible note
based on how many other notes are newly-eligible in the same deck —
**superseded by D91** (operator decision, 2026-10-25): the original 6-note
floor is removed entirely. A card's first occurrence (`A`, or a
single-occurrence type's own letter) ships the run it is minted; any
remaining occurrence for a multi-occurrence type is queued in a persisted,
cross-batch table and drained once 11 other occurrences have landed in that
deck, across however many subsequent publishes that takes (see
`tun/docs/03-data-model.md`'s "Appending new cards to an existing deck").

#### Scenario: A deck with 1 newly-eligible note
- **WHEN** a run finds exactly 1 unminted, eligible note assigned to a deck
- **THEN** it is minted and its first occurrence is published this run, with
  no minimum batch size required

#### Scenario: A multi-occurrence card's second occurrence is queued, not dropped
- **WHEN** a word/expression note is minted and its card's occurrence set is
  `{A, E}`
- **THEN** `A` is appended to the deck's `Cards[]` this run, and `E` is
  queued at `remaining = 11` rather than appended immediately

#### Scenario: A queued occurrence drains once enough new occurrences land
- **WHEN** a deck's cumulative count of newly-appended occurrences since a
  pending row was queued reaches 11
- **THEN** that row's occurrence is appended to the deck's `Cards[]` and the
  row is removed

#### Scenario: A deck with no new cards in a run leaves its queue untouched
- **WHEN** a run mints no new cards for a given deck
- **THEN** that deck's pending occurrence rows are not decremented this run

### Requirement: Every publish regenerates all existing minted cards' content
The system SHALL regenerate the `N`/`E`/`X`/`A` content of every
previously-minted card from stabbur's current note state on every publish
that runs, not only for newly-minted cards, while never altering an existing
card's id, deck assignment, or `Cards[]` position.

#### Scenario: A note is edited after being minted
- **WHEN** a note whose card was minted in an earlier publish is edited on
  stabbur before the next publish
- **THEN** the next publish's bundle reflects the edited content for that
  card's existing id, with its `Cards[]` position and `card_slots` row
  unchanged

### Requirement: Projection from note type to card shape is pure and stateless
The system SHALL derive a card's `{N, E, X, A}` fields and its occurrence set
solely from the note's `type` (and its content), computing this fresh on
every run rather than reading a stored projection.

#### Scenario: Re-running projection on unchanged input
- **WHEN** the same note is projected twice with no change to its content or
  type
- **THEN** both projections produce identical `{N, E, X, A}` output

### Requirement: Publishing triggers on a schedule and on demand
The system SHALL run the full pipeline automatically on a recurring schedule,
and SHALL additionally run it immediately on an explicit operator request,
with both paths subject to the same eligibility rules (no floor — D91).

#### Scenario: Scheduled run with no eligible notes anywhere and nothing ever minted
- **WHEN** the scheduled run executes, no deck has any newly-eligible note,
  and no note has ever been minted
- **THEN** no build_jobs row is created and no publish occurs

#### Scenario: Scheduled run with nothing new but something already minted (D103)
- **WHEN** the scheduled run executes, no deck has any newly-eligible note,
  but at least one note has been minted previously
- **THEN** a build job still runs: already-minted content is regenerated and
  a publish is still attempted — "nothing new" is not treated as "nothing
  to do," since an earlier run's mint may have succeeded while its publish
  step failed, and no later run may otherwise ever retry completing it

#### Scenario: Operator requests an immediate publish
- **WHEN** the operator triggers a publish from the UI
- **THEN** the pipeline runs immediately, independent of the schedule

### Requirement: The forecast reflects the same logic as a real run, without minting
The system SHALL expose a dry-run view that executes the same pull,
eligibility, and deck-assignment logic as a real publish, reporting per-deck
newly-eligible counts and each deck's current pending-occurrence queue depth
(no floor to report crossing/not-crossing — D91), while performing no writes
to `card_slots`, `decks`, `Cards[]`, `pending_occurrences`, or any card
content.

#### Scenario: Forecast after a real publish
- **WHEN** the operator views the forecast immediately after a run that
  published everything currently eligible
- **THEN** every deck shows 0 newly-eligible notes, matching the real run's
  outcome

#### Scenario: Forecast does not mutate state
- **WHEN** the operator views the forecast any number of times
- **THEN** no `card_slots` row, `publications` row, or bundle file is created
  as a result

# Supplies the node runtime for `bin/bundle-tool.js` (the OTA publish CLI,
# D76/D-P2) and, from P4 onward, `builder`/`hub`'s own services — the
# operator is not expected to install node on the VPS itself (D84: this repo
# owns the entire deployable stack). The repo itself is bind-mounted at
# runtime (compose.yaml), not copied in here, so `git pull` + a container
# restart picks up source changes without a rebuild; only `npm ci` — the
# expensive, rarely-changing part — happens at build time.
